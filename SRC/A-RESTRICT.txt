=====================================================================

GPL is a TIMODE (/4A) interpreter that allows the Geneve to emulate
most functionality of the /4A.  This includes running 'dumped' cartridge
files (in GRAM Kracker format) and existing /4a software.

ASSEMBLY AND LINKAGE:
---------------------
GPL is assembled with GenASM and linked with a special linker (TILINK) included
with this package. Makefile has been implemented for this release.

       ASM/N     - GenASM; not included in this package
       !DOIT     - created by make process
       !LINKGPL  - control file for linker
       !MAKEFILE - Make control file
       $MAKE     - Updated to work with 20xx years and TIPI no creationdate
       MAKE      - Batch file to start the make process
       TESTG     - Simple batch to start GPL
       TIM2      - Use "&TIM2" to initialize TIMODE2
       WIPE      - GenWIPE, clears memory prior to linkage

Each source file may be separately assembled using the RCO options.

CHARSETS    - Character definitions for GPL
DSRLNKS     - Ultra standard DSRLNK (carts are loaded in /4a mode)
GETSTRS     - Input routine
KEYS        - Keyboard/joystick routine for /4a emulation
TASK78S     - The TIMODE / GPL interpreter startup and patching
VDPIOS      - Vdp utilities

The GPL program requires additional files to emulate the TI.
       GPM      - Patched ROM
       GPN      - GROM 0
       GPO/GPP  - BASIC GROMS or Menu or other pre-loaded files

Upon execution, GPL will check the TIMODE flag at >0126 and if set, will
continue execution. The print spooler will be allowed to clear before
entering TI Mode. The GPL title screen is interactive unless a cartridge
is specified as a parameter, e.g., GPL XB.

Programmer notes:
       - Direct /4a-style CRU scanning is not emulated by the gate array.
       - Cartridge space at >6000-7FFF is limited by the gate array
       - Level 2 IO is limited to floppy disk devices; ROMPAGE may be
         invoked to support hard drive level 2
       - Powerup routine is now enforced when entering and returning
         from /4a mode to ensure proper DSR setup.
       - GPL task page  number is stored at address >8100; since TI
         programs sometimes write the scratchpad mirrors, be sure to
         exercise caution when using.


LIMITATIONS (as noted in release doc)
-------------------------------------
GPL does not and cannot replace special TI cartridges such as the FinalROM,
FinalGROM, UberGROM, Superspace II.  Some device functionality requires a
mode called 'rompage' that exposes the peripheral expansion bus for programs
needing direct access to the card. Hardware that might benefit from this
mode includes the Myarc HFDC, SCSI, IDE, TIPI, SIDBlaster, and MBP cards.

Programs that require direct scan of the /4a keyboard will not function as
there is no mechanism to emulate the 9901 direct scan process.


ENHANCEMENT LOG:

V7.40  Moved enhancement log to GPL-README.
